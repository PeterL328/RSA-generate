#Description

This is a python script that helps you encrypt, decrypt and generate RSA keys.
To test this program, you may first generate a key with (g), then run the program with (e) to encrypt some text and (d) to decrypt that text.

To use this for assignment, first (e) with Martin's n and e value that he provided on Learn and encrypt your secret message. Then, run the
program with (g) to generate key values and record them and write them in google docs. After, Martin has replied to you with a cipher text.
Run the program with (d) and put in the recorded keys that YOU generated.
